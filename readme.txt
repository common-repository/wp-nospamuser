"WP-NoSpamUser" is all about blocking potential spammers from registering on your blog.

== Description ==

This is my first plugin for the blogging platform named "Wordpress". It's called "WP-NoSpamUser" and it is all about blocking potential spammers from registering on your blog. It compares the username and the email-address with the ones in the database at http://www.stopforumspam.com. If it gets a positive result, it immediately prevents the potential spammer from registering on your blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-nospamuser.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
